## 🤖 About Our AI Moderation

We use AI to help keep this space safe:

- **Every image/video upload** is automatically scanned for pornographic content
- **Reported content** is analyzed for hate speech and illegal material
- **AI isn't perfect** — false positives happen and can be appealed

### If You Get Flagged by Mistake

1. Your content may be temporarily hidden
2. A human moderator will review it
3. If it's a false positive, your content is restored
4. No strike is counted against your account

## 🔒 Why No Porn?

We're an **adults-only** platform, but we've chosen to be **porn-free** because:

1. **We can't verify ages perfectly.** Some minors might slip through. Removing all porn protects them.
2. **Legal compliance.** German law requires us to prevent minors from accessing adult content. We can't guarantee that, so we don't host it.
3. **Community focus.** We want a space for ideas and connection, not adult content.

There are plenty of platforms for adult content. This isn't one of them.

---

## 📢 Reporting

### When to Report

- Content that could harm minors
- Hate speech or discrimination
- Harassment or threats
- Illegal content
- Spam

### How to Report

1. Click the **⋯** menu on any post
2. Select **Report**
3. Choose a category
4. Add details if needed
5. Submit

Reports are confidential. The reported user won't know who reported them.

## ⚖️ Legal Framework

This instance operates under **German law**, including:

- **§130 StGB** — Volksverhetzung (Incitement of hatred)
- **§184b StGB** — Child pornography

## 🤝 The Spirit of These Rules

These rules exist to create a space where:

- Adults can have real conversations
- Controversial opinions can be debated
- Creative expression is encouraged
- **But** vulnerable people are protected
- **And** illegal content has no place

We're not here to police thoughts. We're here to prevent harm.
